			# and cyclic references, but this comes at the expense of a small overhead  
			# nograph does not support object grpahs with shared nodes, but is usually faster

			# Possible values for idstrategy are:  
			# default, explicit, incremental  
			#  
			# default - slowest and produces bigger serialized representation. Contains fully-  
			# qualified class names (FQCNs) for each class  
			#  
			# explicit - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Requires that all  
			# classes that will be serialized are pre-registered using the "mappings" section  
			# To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same  
			# classes it is advised to provide exactly the same entries in the "mappings" section   
			#  
			# incremental - fast and produces compact serialized representation. Support optional  
			# pre-registering of classes using the "mappings" and "classes" sections. If class is  
			# not pre-registered, it will be registered dynamically by picking a next available id  
			# To guarantee that both sender and receiver use the same numeric ids for the same   
			# classes it is advised to pre-register them using at least the "classes" section
